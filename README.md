# ePiggyWeb

The team:

Arnas Rimkus, Deividas Kučinskas, Matas Lazdauskas, Gytis Bečalis

Notes for other teams:
 - Run both the ePiggyWeb.sln and CurrencyConverter.sln solutions
 - Only the index page works without a database, so you need to set one up
 - Database connection string is stored in user secrets, change it to your database connection string and it should work
 - I think we did a mistake and deleted the migrations we used to create and udpate the database (we used mssql), so if you need them for reference I might be able to dig them up from the commits if needed
 - I know you guys used MVC, but this project is made using Razor pages, so it might look a little bit different
 - If you have any questions just message ciliakas (or Peperalus #4922 on discord)
